# Conrete Material Set - EN1992-1-1
- This plug-in can input concrete material and time-dependent properties based on EN1992-1-1 and show the calculation process values and the final results on the graphs.

## Details
### version 1.0.0
- Based on EN1992-1-1, input Concrete Material and Time-Dependent Properties at once.
- Based on EN1992-1-1, shows calculating process value and the final results: Strength, Creep, Shrinkage
    - The graph shows the stress-strain relation as a non-linear, parabola-rectangle, and bi-linear relationship.
    - The Time-Dependent properties are shown in Creep, Shrinkage, Mean Compressive strength, Mean Tensile strength, and Elastic modulus in the graph.
- Within the Time-Dependent Properties input, it is possible to choose the CODE to EN1992-2; however, it does not provide a calculation result.
- Calculated Time-Dependent Properties do not apply to MIDAS CIVIL NX. It only applies based on the input value.
